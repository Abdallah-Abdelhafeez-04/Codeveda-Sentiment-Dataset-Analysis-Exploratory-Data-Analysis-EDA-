# Codeveda-second-Task-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
In this task, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Sentiment Dataset.   The dataset contains short text entries with assigned sentiment/emotion labels along with metadata such as *Retweets* and *Likes*.  

### Goals of EDA
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Identify missing values and duplicates  
- Explore sentiment distribution  
- Analyze relationships between numerical features (Retweets, Likes) and sentiment labels  

### Key Steps
- Checked dataset shape, columns, and missing values  
- Visualized the **distribution of sentiments** (bar chart of top 15 labels)  
- Created a **scatter plot** to study the relationship between *Retweets* and *Likes* colored by sentiment
